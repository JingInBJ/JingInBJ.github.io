      <p class="body-text serif">When the new semester is around the corner, Chinese students and scholars seeking to study in the U.S. may find it is harder than before to obtain a U.S. visa.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Recently Chinese students and scholars have encountered an increase in visa refusals and duration limits of their visas, China’s Ministry of Education released a warning statement in June, reminding “the need to strength risk assessment before studying abroad.” </p>

      <p class="body-text serif">Even they successfully enter the U.S., international students who want to work in the U.S. after graduation, may find their wings are clipped due to duration limit of their visas and a new interpretation of employers obligations issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">A Chinese graduate student majored in computer science in New York said that unlike the previous STEM students who can get five years F-1 visa, many of her classmates and herself only got one-year student visa, which cannot cover the whole master program.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">The explanation issued by USCIS last April applies to optional practical training, known as OPT, which enables international students to work in the U.S. after graduation for one year or three years at most for those majored in STEM, spelling out that students cannot work at the employers’ client sites, making it harder to find a suitable job.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Moreover, the country’s “Buy American and Hire American” executive order implemented in 2017 has raised concerns that if the OPT program will be canceled entirely in the future.</p>
