      <p class="body-text serif">After five years’ construction, China’s new US$13 billion Beijing Daxing International Airport will start operation in September, being the capital city’s second aviation hub.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Designed by ADP Ingénierie and legendary architect Zaha Hadid, the starfish-shaped airport “is the world’s largest integrated transportation hub,” said Guo Yanchi, chief engineer in charge of construction work, according to a local newspaper China Daily. </p>

      <p class="body-text serif">The new mega airport is expected to handle 45 million passengers annually by 2021 and 72 million by 2025. </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Beijing has already had a mega airport located in the north east of the city but the growing passenger traffic have made the “dual hub” strategy a must do. </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Back in 2007, Beijing Capital International Airport (code as PEK) ranked at No.7 in the world in terms of passenger traffic. To prepare for Olympic Games in the same year, its new T3 terminal finished construction in February 2008 but still not enough to handle the surging needs. </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">In 2007, the airport’s ranking has jumped to the second with more than 95 million passenger traffic, only next to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport., according to data from Airports Council International. </p>

      <p class="body-text serif">The pressure keeps climbing. The International Air Transport Association has predicted China will overtake the U.S. as the largest aviation market in the world by 2022.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Under the heavy passenger traffic, the airport has fell short of passengers’ expectation for punctuality. Among the busiest 10 airports in 2017, Beijing airport took the bottom of ranking with only 63.54 percent of flights could be on time, according to data from OAG, an air travel intelligence company.</p>

          <p class="body-text serif">Now with the Daxing airport, the Beijing airport will not struggle alone to meet the growing needs.</p>
          <p class="body-text serif">Moreover, the new airport is also a part of development plan for the capital city’s southern suburbs and far south, including its neighbor city Tianjin and Hebei province. The region surrounding Beijing has been overshadowed by the capital for many years and the government has been planning a grand project to create a world-class city cluster centered around Beijing.</p>
